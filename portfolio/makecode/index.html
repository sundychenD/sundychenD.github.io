			Background
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			In cooperation with Cornell CIS MPS Program, Microsoft Research (Redmond) proposed this project of building customized coding environment with <a class="uk-link" href="https://makecode.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft MakeCode</a>. The ultimate project goal is to build a programming platform that allows people with very few programming experience building JavaScript applications.
			<br>
			<br>
			During this semester-long project, we worked in a group of three, together with two engineers from Microsoft Research to build this application.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project is presented during Cornell MPS 2017 Fall Project Showcase & Cornell 2018 Engineering Project Showcase.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project is being published in Microsoft MakeCode Labs. It can be accessed <a href="https://sundychend.github.io/BuildUFace/" class="uk-link" target="_blank">here</a>.

			GOAL - Effortless AR Programming Environment
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			Augmented reality applications have become pervasive across desktop and mobile platforms. Popular AR apps such as SNOW, Snapchat, and the newly released Apple Animoji are very popular amongst people. However, building such an AR app can be very difficult.
		</div>
		<img src="./images/animoji.png">

		<div class="content-body">
			How can we empower people with few or even none programming background to write their own AR programs? Microsoft MakeCode provides us a solution.
			<br>
			<br>
			Microsoft MakeCode is a platform providing a JavaScript programming environment that enables people with few programming experiences to build complicated applications. Instead of letting user writing every detail of the code, the user would develop their application through a pseudo-code playground that is non-programmer friendly.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			What is "Efforless Programming"
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			One advantage of MakeCode is that it allows the user to build applications by constructing visual blocks of functions. In such a way. The user does not need to know details of JavaScript semantics in order to complete a program. Aside from that. Visual blocks also give a better view of the flow of the program. Thus, it is easy to interpret the purpose of the code even for non-programmers.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once user is more comfortable reading/writing JavaScript code, he/she could then switch from blocky view to editor view and build with actual JavaScript code.
			<br>
			<br>
			However, even in the editor view, the user would only write pseudo code to build their applications. The "dirty work" of how each API actually works is hidden from the user's perspective. As such, we enable user to experience the actual programming flow yet keep the playground simple and clean.

		<div class="content-body">
			When kids are playing with Lego blocks, they are not just simply stacking bricks. The whole process enables them to learn and understand the concept of object selection, color matching, pattern sorting etc. Empowered with MakeCode, this open source platform should teach the user a sense of AR programming with JavaScript. 
			<br>
			<br>
			More importantly, as the core feature of this application, it should provide user with a diverse set of face tracking based augmented reality functions so that user could customize their own AR apps in a creative way.

		<div class="content-body">
			MIT Scratch is designed for Kids to learn how to program by constructing blocks of different functions. Each of the blocks is able to add one animation effect to the cat in the simulator. For instance “move 10 steps” would trigger the cat moving 10 frames towards a preset direction.
			<br>
			<br>
			MakeCode micro:bit is a native MakeCode project. It has a hardware simulator environment for the user to test their constructed code. Creating a project within micro:bit requires users to have a basic mental model of hardware I/O.
			<br>
			<br>
			Both projects are the best representation of their field. Scratch is a great educational platform for people who have zero programming knowledge. micro:bit, however requires users to have a bit knowledge of programming, but not to the point of knowing every detail of how hardware works. Both provide user great flexibility in terms of function construction. We thus compared these two platforms in terms of language design, teaching approach etc.
		</div>

		<img src="./images/compare.png">

		<div class="content-body">
			There is no right or wrong approach in terms of building the programming environment, only the one that best suits the user need. As of current, we think that both platforms pointed out some possible directions of how we could construct our own programming environment for our users. The question left for us is, how to describe our user need?

All the phrases we use simply describes the result of the function would achieve without any implementation details exposed to the user.
			<br>
			<br>
			This indeed satisfies the need for non-programmer to use the application. User's ability to customize their own augmented reality logic flow is sacrificed.

			Even within the Face Detector module, functions are separated into basic and advanced categories. By default, advanced features are hidden in the dropdown and would not expose to the user, thus reducing the load of information.
