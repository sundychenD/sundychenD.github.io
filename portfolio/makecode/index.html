		<div class="content-body">
			In cooperation with Cornell CIS MPS Program, Microsoft Research (Redmond) proposed this project of building customized coding environment with <a class="uk-link" href="https://makecode.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft MakeCode</a>. The ultimate project goal is to build a programming platform that allows people with very few programming experience building JavaScript applications.
			<br>
			<br>
			During this semester-long project, we worked in a group of three, together with two engineers from Microsoft Research to build this application.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project is presented during Cornell MPS 2017 Fall Project Showcase & Cornell 2018 Engineering Project Showcase.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project is being published in Microsoft MakeCode Labs. It can be accessed <a href="https://sundychend.github.io/BuildUFace/" class="uk-link" target="_blank">here</a>.

		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Problem
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			Augmented reality applications have become pervasive across desktop and mobile platforms. Popular AR apps such as SNOW, Snapchat, and the newly released Apple Animoji are very popular amongst people. However, building such an AR app can be very difficult.
		</div>

		<img src="./images/animoji.png">

		<div class="content-body">
			How can we empower people with few or even none programming background to build their own AR apps? Microsoft MakeCode provides us a solution.
			<br>
			<br>
			Microsoft MakeCode is a platform providing a JavaScript programming environment that enables people with few programming experiences to build complicated applications. Instead of letting user writing every detail of the code, the user would develop their application through a pseudo-code playground that is non-programmer friendly.

		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			When kids are playing with Lego blocks, they are not just simply stacking bricks. The whole process enables them to learn and understand the concept of object selection, color matching, pattern sorting etc. Empowered with MakeCode, this open source platform should teach the user a sense of programming with JavaScript. 
			<br>
			<br>
			More importantly, as the core feature of this application, it should provide user with a diverse set of face tracking based augmented reality functions so that user could customize their own AR apps in a creative way.

			<br>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Efforless Programming
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			One advantage of MakeCode is that it allows the user to build applications by constructing visual blocks of functions. In such a way. The user does not need to know details of JavaScript semantics in order to complete a program. Aside from that. Visual blocks also give a better view of the flow of the program. Thus, it is easy to interpret the purpose of the code even for non-programmers.
			<br>
			<br>
			Once user is more comfortable reading/writing JavaScript code, he/she could then switch from blocky view to editor view and build with actual JavaScript code.
			<br>
			<br>
			However, even in the editor view, the user would only write pseudo code to build their applications. The "dirty work" of how each API actually works is hidden from the user's perspective. As such, we enable user to experience the actual programming flow yet keep the playground simple and clean.

			Design Process

		<div class="content-body">
			The project is developed through a double diamond structure. We always started off with research or brainstorming to gather a rich set of ideas, then narrowing down into a few major pain points. 
		</div>

		<img src="./images/diamond.png">

		<!-- DISCOVER -->
		<div class="content-subtitle">
			<span class="title-bold">DISCOVER</span>
			<img src="./images/discover.png" class="title-avatar">
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			We first started looking at existing applications in the market and examine how they tackle similar problems. 
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Case Study: MIT Scratch & MakeCode micro:bit
		</div>

		<img src="./images/case.png">

		<div class="content-body">
			MIT Scratch is designed for Kids to learn how to program by constructing blocks of different functions. Each of the blocks is able to add one animation effect to the cat in the simulator. For instance “move 10 steps” would trigger the cat moving 10 frames towards a preset direction.
			<br>
			<br>
			MakeCode micro:bit is a native MakeCode project. It has a hardware simulator environment for the user to test their constructed code. Creating a project within micro:bit requires users to have a basic mental model of hardware I/O.
			<br>
			<br>
			Both projects are the best representation of their field. Scratch is a great educational platform for people who have zero programming knowledge. micro:bit, however requires users to have a bit knowledge of programming, but not to the point of knowing every detail of how hardware works. Both provide user great flexibility in terms of function construction. We thus compared these two platforms in terms of language design, teaching approach etc.

			<img src="./images/define.png" class="title-avatar">
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			To explore the pain point of our user, the question we have to answer is: 
			<b>What's the most frustrated moment of learning to code?</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			We invited our user to use some existing MakeCode projects and asked their feedbacks the usage.
			<br>
			<br>
			From the survey, we got a rough picture of the actual user problem. 
		</div>

		<img src="./images/pain.png">

		<div class="content-body">
			From there on, the problem then is narrowed down to three opportunity areas worth exploring:
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>HMW</b> ease the learning curve of JavaScript semantics?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>HMW</b> reduce the complexity of blocky construction?
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>HMW</b> make an easy-to-understand AR simulator?

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Plain English in Function Blocks
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			Instead of having technical function blocks e.g. "canvas creation", simply name it as "draw". Function blocks named in plain English creates a better beginner friendly learning environment so that the user would not be scared away by complicated technical jargons.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Start with Simple Functions
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			Instead of giving user overly complicated function blocks, we start by giving the user a set of simple function blocks to play with. It's good for the user to establish a mental model of the coding environment and getting familiar with programming with function blocks.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Hide Unnecessary Implementation Details
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			The advantage of coding with function blocks is that it can hide implementation details. For beginners, they are not required to know how the function blocks actually work behind the scene. To them, all that matters is the input and output of the function block.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Integrate Complicate Logic
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			Although the programming with function blocks imposes the idea of "Hiding Details" into the coding environment, we still need to consider what level of detail is being hidden. We need to find a balance between hiding too much detail thus losing flexibility in construction, or exposing too much detail thus overwhelming the user.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Use Daily Life Objects in AR Simulator
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			The best way to make the coding environment beginner friendly is giving user objects they could recognize to play with. With that, we used a set of well-recognized facial masks in our implementation.

			With the help of journey map, we could better define possible actions the user could perform in using the application. It also helps us understand the user's mental model and their goals in the usage.

			In the first prototype, we delivered four basic function blocks.

						Face Masks

					<li>
						Face Substitution
					</li>
					<li>
						Face Outline
					</li>
					<li>
						Face Deformation
					</li>
				</ul>
			Simple as they are defined, each of the function is performing one atomic action to user's face in the webcam.
			<br>
			<br>
			By calling the function inside a "forever loop", or an infinite "while loop", the simulator would use the webcam video to lively render user's face with the selected effect.

		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			In the first prototype, the simplicity of function blocks is what we aiming to achieve. Thus, every augmented reality function blocks delivered does only one atomic action and does exactly as its description says.
			<br>
			<br>
			This indeed satisfies the need for non-programmer to use the application. User's ability to customize their own augmented reality logic flow is sacrificed.
			<br>
			<br>
			In order to make the function blocks more playable, we need to introduce some complexities to advanced users.

				Prototype 2.0
			</span>
		</div>
		<div class="content-body">
			To introduce more customization into the programming environment, we created a new module -- Face Detector.
			<br>
			<br>
			All the augmented reality function blocks are kept as they are and can be used as normal. The newly introduced module is separated from them.
			<br>
			<br>
			For beginner users, they can explore the full function of augmented reality in an effortless way. However, for advanced users, they could manipulate function blocks in Face Detector to create more customized programs.
			<br>
			<br>
			Even within the Face Detector module, functions are separated into basic and advanced categories. By default, advanced features are hidden in the dropdown and would not expose to the user, thus reducing the load of information.

		<div class="content-body">
			With augmented reality module and face detector module, we are able to satisfy the need of user at different skill set levels. The project is able to deliver a complete programming experience at the moment. However, can we do more about this?
			<br>
			<br>
			The fun part about MIT Scratch is that the whole programming experience more of a gaming experience. As we see users are able to manipulate the character in the simulator from Scratch, we are thinking of whether we could also introducing similar gaming experience into the programming environment.
