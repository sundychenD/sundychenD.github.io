		<div class="content-body">
			We have so many musical apps today. We download our favorite albums from online stores. We create our own musical playlist. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Our playlist becomes longer, our artist library becomes bigger. However, all in all, it is the user who is building their own library, and what they can play is what they already have.
			<br>
			<br>
			The problem arises here: "I'm getting bored of my old songs, I want new ones".
			<br>
			<br>
			In reality, we already have a brilliant solution -- "Radio Stations", where there are professional editors who do the job of creating new playlist and make sure songs seldom get repeated. 
			<br>
			<br>
			We want to mimic that process of radio station, however in a more intelligent way and empower user more power of control.
		</div>

		<div class="content-subtitle">
			Solution: User Controlled Radio Experience.
		</div>

		<div class="content-body">
			We want to keep the experience of listening to radio station, where songs are prompted up instead of selected from user library.
			<br>
			<br>
			However, unlike traditional radio station, the user does not always have to finish a song he/she doesnt like. They have the power to choose to skip a song.
			<br>
			<br>
			More importantly, the songs arent prompted in a random way. New songs are selected based on user's taste of music.
			<br>
			<br>
			In other words, we always try to prompt new songs, but still keep genre allied with the taste that user is familiar with.

		<div class="content-body">
			Yuki is a music lover. He has a huge library of both digital and physical collection of music.
			<br>
			<br>
			Although he enjoys his collection very much, he always want to listen to new songs. And he actively doing researches on artist, exploring their genre of composition, and trying to find similar pieces.
			<br>
			<br>
			In his music app, he uses "Guess You May Like" function pretty heavily. He thinks the function is an effective way of finding new songs with old taste, however he find the number of recommendation under such feature is too limited, usually he ended up with only a few album recommended.
			<br>
			<br>
			He listens to radio as well. He like the way radio station automatically chooses new songs for him. However the problem with that is he can't skip a song he doesnt like.

			Just like ordinary music apps, the online music library is sorted by Album / Artist / Genre, each one of them is a <b>Playlist</b>, where each individual songs are stored inside. User can get a familiar music browsing experience just like every other apps. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The prominent difference is the <b>Channel</b> category, where only artist would be included in the list but not specific songs. It can be played, however the user would not know what song would be prompted next. This allows user to explore new songs in a more free way.

			The core feature of the app is built around the Radio feature. Where users are always prompted with new songs, and they can choose to <b>Trash</b>, <b>Like</b> or <b>Skip</b> a song.
			<br>
			<br>
			The "Trash" option make sures the song would never appear in future recommendation. 
			The "Like" options would add the song into user's collection, and affects on future recommendation. 
			The "Skip" option simply skips the song prompted.

			To mimic the Radio experience, the radio channel song pool has "infinite" number of songs, the selection of songs are based on the channel's characteristics, which are either artist type or genre.
