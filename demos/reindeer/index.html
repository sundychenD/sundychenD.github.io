					When we ask people about what platform do they use to conduct or attend a tutorial online, apps that are mostly mentioned are "Skype", "Google Hangouts" or even "Facebook". These apps are great, but they are NOT designed dedicated for conducting online tutorials. To solve this problem, we need a brand new platform.

					That's where <i>Reindeer</i> comes in. It aims to provide the ultimate solution to help students in National University of Singapore to attend tutorials online, regardless of what type of tutorials they are attending. The platform should be substantially simple to use, yet flexible enough to cater tutorials with different needs.

				What's so good about attending a tutorial physically? Because you got a white board to draw. Why professors bring laptops to the class? Because they love powerpoints. So <i>Reindeer</i> combines them TOGETHER!

			<br>
			<br>

			<span class="section-text">
				In the virtual tutorial room of <i>Reindeer</i>, we combined the powerpoint with the white board function. Presenter can show the slides and mark on it freely with their iPad. (an iPad?). YES you can use an iPad in parallel with desktop portal logged in. The iPad will become a drawing board and synchronized with the class.

			<span class="section-text">
				And thanks to the <i>WebRTC</i> technology, we can live stream your voice to the class room. However live streaming is expensive and requires a LOT of server power and bandwidth. We managed to get it work in a LAN environment. So long as you are inside campus sub-network for instance your dormintory, you can use the voice function! A chatting box is provided in case the student is outside of campus and access from the World Wide Web.
