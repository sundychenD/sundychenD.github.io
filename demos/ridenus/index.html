					Is there a better way to facilitate students traveling in campus? That's the problem this project is aiming to solve. The existing shuttle bus system is overly crowded during peak hours, however for non-peak time, it then become under-used, thus we think more flexibility in terms of transporting power needs to be introduced.

			<div id="problem-paragraph-2" class="subparagraph uk-width-small-2-3 uk-container-center transparent">
				<p>
					A good way we found out, through a series of user studies, is that a electrical scooter rental system could meet the requirement. Thus, we developed such a system that people could pick up scooters easily around NUS campus.

							Why scooters?
						</div>
						<div>
							Scooter has a more flexible transporting power, when someone finishes up using, the other can take it.
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div>
							Why go electrical?
						</div>
						<div>
							Ordinary bike used to be on our list, however considering the large number of slopes in NUS campus, electric powered one takes less efforts to ride.

					<li>
						<div>
							Who are the target user?

						<div>
							NUS Staffs & Students
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div>
							A bit too fictitious?
						</div>
						<div>
							The security patrolling vehicle around campus has all switches to self balancing scooters, sounds like a good time to make the idea more prevailing.

				From the initial empirical research, the four requirements listed above are the core pain points we found out, and with that as a functionality & design guidance, we proposed 4 different high-fidelity prototypes for the first round of user evaluation.
				<br>
				<br> Four versions are built seperately and in parallel, with that we could explore the full power of creativity of each one of our group.
